# example-elm-composition

This example shows you how to compose child and parent elements such that a 
child and parent can pass data and a child can pass data to another child via
its parent. Assuming you have elm-0.17 installed, you can run this example with:

```
elm-reactor
```

then go to `http://localhost:8000/Parent.elm`.
